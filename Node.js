// JavaScript Runtime

// i. Design the Language

// function myFunc(){ // We also write JS function multiple ways
//     console.log("Hello world");
// }

// ii. Execute the Language

// Create JavaScript engine for browser
// Each browser has its own JavaScript engine, with Chrome using V8, Firefox using SpiderMonkey, and Safari using JavaScriptCore.
// Node js is not a programming Language
// Node js is a C++ program. We are able to use Node js in any machine
// So Node js is a javaScript runtime powerd by V8 engine and which is also run in  out side the browser that means web server
//Extra knowledge for Java use Tomcat Server which are able to handle multiple request at a time

//Non-blocking I/o
// Non-blocking I/O means Node.js does not wait for one task to finish before moving to the next. It handles multiple tasks at the same time without stopping the program.

// Example:

// You order food at a restaurant. Instead of waiting for your food, you can talk to your friend.
// When the food is ready, the waiter brings it to you.
// Similarly, Node.js handles tasks in the background and continues working on other things.

//Asyncronous (call back function)

// # part 3
//Loadash
// What is Lodash?
// Lodash is a JavaScript library that works on the top of underscore.js. It helps in working with arrays, strings, objects, numbers, etc.
// It provides us with various inbuilt functions and uses a functional programming approach which that coding in JavaScript easier to understand
// because instead of writing repetitive functions, tasks can be accomplished with a single line of code. It also makes it easier to work with
// objects in JavaScript if they require a lot of manipulation to be done on them.

// Why Lodash?
// It provides various inbuilt functions for collections, arrays, manipulated objects, and other utility methods that we can use directly instead
// of writing them from scratch. It makes it easier to iterate over the arrays, strings as well as objects. Its modular methods make the creation
// of composite functions easier.

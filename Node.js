// JavaScript Runtime

// i. Design the Language

// function myFunc(){ // We also write JS function multiple ways
//     console.log("Hello world");
// }


// ii. Execute the Language

// Create JavaScript engine for browser
// Each browser has its own JavaScript engine, with Chrome using V8, Firefox using SpiderMonkey, and Safari using JavaScriptCore. 
// Node js is not a programming Language
// Node js is a C++ program. We are able to use Node js in any machine
// So Node js is a javaScript runtime powerd by V8 engine and which is also run in  out side the browser that means web server
//Extra knowledge for Java use Tomcat Server which are able to handle multiple request at a time

//Non-blocking I/o
// Non-blocking I/O means Node.js does not wait for one task to finish before moving to the next. It handles multiple tasks at the same time without stopping the program.

// Example:

// You order food at a restaurant. Instead of waiting for your food, you can talk to your friend.
// When the food is ready, the waiter brings it to you.
// Similarly, Node.js handles tasks in the background and continues working on other things.

//Asyncronous (call back function)
